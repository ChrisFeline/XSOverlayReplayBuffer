# XSOverlayReplayBuffer
 XSOverlay Mod for OBS Replay Buffer.

> I will make a new plugin when XSOverlay officially releases plugins.

# How to?
Just download the repo, then open `install.bat`. It will try to place the files on their location.

- In your OBS Studio, go to:
  - `Tools` > `WebSocket Settings`
  - Check: Enable WebSocket server.
  - Click Apply.
