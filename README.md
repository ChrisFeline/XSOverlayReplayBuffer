# XSOverlayReplayBuffer
 XSOverlay Mod for OBS Replay Buffer.
 - This modification will add a button that can control the `OBS Studio Replay Buffer` feature.
 - With this you can save replays of things happening on your screen without having to use a window capture to click on OBS.

> I will make a new plugin when XSOverlay officially releases plugins.

# How to?
[**Download**](https://github.com/ChrisFeline/XSOverlayReplayBuffer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repo, extract it, then open `install.bat`.

- In your OBS Studio, go to:
  - `Tools` > `WebSocket Settings`
  - Check: Enable WebSocket server.
  - Click Apply.
