 XSOverlay Mod for OBS Replay Buffer.

> I will make a new plugin when XSOverlay officially releases plugins.

# How to?
Just download the repo, then open `install.bat`. It will try to place the files on their location.
<br>If that doesn't work, just place the content's of the mod folder inside of the root of XSOverlay.
<br>You can figure it out.

- In your OBS Studio, go to:
